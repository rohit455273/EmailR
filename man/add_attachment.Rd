\title{Add a file attachment to an email message}
\usage{
add_attachment(
  email,
  file,
  content_type = mime::guess_type(file),
  filename = basename(file)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{email}{The email message object, as created by the \code{\link[=compose_email]{compose_email()}}
function. The object's class is \code{email_message}.}

\item{file}{The filename for the file to be attached.}

\item{content_type}{The MIME type for the attachment. By default, this is
guessed by the \code{mime::guess_type()} function on the basis of the \code{file}'s
extension. The available MIME types that can be guessed are available in
the \code{mime::mimemap} named character vector.}

\item{filename}{the filename for the attachment. This can be different than
the basename provided to \code{file} for the purpose of customization. By
default, the basename of \code{file} is taken to be the attachment's filename.}
}
\description{
This gives us a simple interface for attaching a file to the email object.
When it comes time to send the email through \code{\link[=smtp_send]{smtp_send()}}, all attachments
(specified by individual calls to \code{add_attachment()}) will be faithfully
transmitted along with the message.
}
\details{
There are options available to specify the attachment's MIME type, its
disposition, and customize the attachment's recipient-facing filename.
