\name{block_title}
\alias{block_title}
\title{A block with large title text}
\usage{
block_title(title)
}
\arguments{
\item{title}{Plain text or Markdown text (via \code{\link[=md]{md()}}) for the title.}
}
\description{
With \code{block_title()} we can define a title text area and this can be easily
combined with other \verb{block_*()} functions. The title will take the entire
width of the block and will resize according to screen width. Like all
\verb{block_*()} functions, \code{block_title()} must be placed inside of \code{blocks()}
and the resultant \code{blocks} object can be provided to the \code{body}, \code{header}, or
\code{footer} arguments of \code{compose_email()}.
}
\examples{
# Create a block of two, side-by-side
# articles with two `article()` calls
# inside of `block_articles()`, itself
# placed in `blocks()`; also, include a
# title at the top with `block_title()`
